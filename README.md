# Ethnic-influences-on-ASD
This research project aims to examine the discrepancy in proper classification models for identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in participants. Through thorough application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and clustering analysis based on participants' country of residence as part of the methodology, this project explores its effectiveness compared to other classification models. Additionally, this project ventures to employ the proposed model to facilitate individuals with ASD through a digital user interface, recommending personalized intervention strategies for enhancing their social skills and overall standard of living. This project assimilates knowledge from psychology, data science, and social science to impart valuable knowledge into ASD diagnosis, intervention methods, and individualized techniques. The proposed ANN model will furnish a more comprehensive understanding of effective intervention methods and clustering analysis will present clarity upon the ethnic influences on ASD which would deliver beneficial information for researchers, psychologists, and guardians having children diagnosed with ASD.
